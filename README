3D Printed Music, Rickard Dahlstrand, <rd at tilde dot se>

NO PRINTER WHERE HARMED DURING THE MAKING OF THIS HACK!
(however this doesn't mean that yours won't be, use at own risk)

This code was hacked witout mercy during the art hack day in Stockholm 2013.
Using a Lulzbot 3D-printer I tried to visualize different classical musical pieces.

The project explores the alternative uses of 3D-printers. It's being used to create
unique art by printing classical pieces of music while at the same time acting as 
an instrument and performing the music itself.

The stepper motors controlling the movement can be run at different speeds,
the speed decides the pitch of the sound and makes it possible for the motors to make music.

Three motors each represent one of the tracks and their movement makes an unique pattern.
The two motors controlling the Z-axis moves only slightly to increase
the height. Microphones on the motors picks up the sound and amplifies it.

People have been playing music on their 3d-printers for a long time, but I wanted to see
what music looked like 3D-printed. You'll be amazed at the results.

The music I seleced for this project where:
1. Williams - Star Wars: Imperial March
2. Rossini - William Tell Overture
3. Beethoven - 5th Symphony Part 1
4. Mozart - Serenade No.13 in G for strings Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (K.525)
5. Strauss - Blue Danube
6. Bizet - Carmen: Habanera
